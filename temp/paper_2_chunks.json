With the  DLPS, we deployed  blockchain networks as a cluster of virtual machines  (one node per virtual machine ) on Amazon Web Services ’ (AWS) EC2 platform . Each of the nodes in our setup had 4 virtual cores (corresponding to 2 physical cores) and 8 GB of RAM. This m5 series configuration yields a good tradeoff between throughput and costs for many of the examined blockchains3. Moreover, w e set up  client virtual machine s to broadcast  transactions to the cluster of  blockchain nodes . We then  measured the nodes’  resource utilization  (CPU and memory) for different rates of throughput  (transactions per second sent from the client virtual machines ).",

To translate resource utilization into power consumption levels , we used  available  power consumption  estimates  for instances of the AWS EC2 m5 server series , which is based on Intel Xeon 8175 processors  with 48 physical cores3. Specifically, we assumed  around  100 W for idle consumption up to 550  W for maximum CPU and memory usage . These estimates  are in line with those used by the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute  (CCRI)4 to calculate the energy needs of PoS networks . For instance , the CCRI  estimate s that a Solana node consumes  around 80  W for idle consumption and 220 W under average l oad. Manufacturer specification s for the hardware used by the CCRI , in turn, suggest 280 W for maximum CPU usage .

In a second step, w e did the same attribution for 100  % CPU and memory utilization  respectively . In the third and last step, we interpolated the power needs for 0 % and 100  % resource utilization,  which gave us a function to  translate resource utilization into power consumption levels . To increase robustness, we conducted our measurements  for different throughput rates and conducted  each measurement three times (sending requests with a fixed throughput rate for 20 seconds to a blockchain network with 32 nodes) .",

After validating that marginal resource utilization was approximately linear ly dependent on  throughput, w e then worked with average d values  for Figure 1 .

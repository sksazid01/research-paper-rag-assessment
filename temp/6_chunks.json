It discusses the challenge of power consumption by analyzing various approaches to estimating power consumption in the literature. A case study of bitcoin is presented for this purpose. The study presents a review of the growing energy consumption of bitcoin along with a solution for immersion cooling in blockchain mining. The second challenge addressed in this research is scalability. With the increase in network size, scalability issues are also increasing as the number of transactions per second is decreasing. In other words, blockchain is observing low throughput with its increase in size. The paper discusses research studies and techniques proposed in the literature. The paper then investigates how to scale blockchain for better performance. Keywords: blockchain; bitcoin; scalability; power consumption; immersion cooling",

Keywords: blockchain; bitcoin; scalability; power consumption; immersion cooling In the current world, centralized systems govern the majority of ﬁnancial transactions between people or businesses. In other cases, they can be managed by a third-party organization. In the case of a digital payment or transfer between two businesses, a bank or credit card vendor, for example, functions as a third party. All successful transactions are paid for by the client ﬁrms. A third-party ﬁrm handles and manages practically all of the interaction in the online process in this one-size-ﬁts-all approach. This approach obviously requires the use of a third party to ensure the transaction’s security. A blockchain, on the other hand, is a widely dispersed and securely managed peer-to-peer network where no third party is necessary to handle information and trust between network users.",

Following Bitcoin, plenty of alternative currencies have emerged. In 2017, cryp- tocurrencies were launched and offered to the public in 2019 with a variety of business ideas.

[ 3], which make projections about upcoming carbon emissions or compare bitcoin and metal mining, are based on basic energy consumption estimations and lack empirical grounding [4,5]. The second part of this paper examines the scalability problem (second contribution). Blockchain technology faces scalability problems when a large number of nodes and transactions are added. This issue occurs signiﬁcantly in public blockchain technology because each node is required to record and run a computational activity to authenticate each transaction (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum).

Actually, miners are effectively being com- pensated for acting as auditors. They are responsible for examining the authenticity of cryptocurrencies. The survey discusses important information.

RQ6: How can we save energy consumption in bitcoin mining? With its interconnected network of nodes, blockchain is reshaping the ﬁnancial sector, making money transactions easier, and reshaping the global economy. Although mining cryptocurrencies have a high annual environmental cost, this may outweigh the advantages. Presently, more than 0.6% of the world’s energy usage is attributed to Bitcoin mining exclusively. Therefore, RQ6 aims to propose a solution to save energy consumption in bitcoin mining.",

The Scalability Challenge In various recent studies, the challenge of scalability has also been highlighted. It was ﬁrst deﬁned by Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum co-founder. According to Vitalik, trade-offs are unavoidable when it comes to three key blockchain properties: security, decentralization, and scalability. The core and essence of blockchain is decentralization. Security is a very important attribute, but scalability has much more importance [11]. Energies 2023 ,16, 1510 7 of 24 Energies 2023 , 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW  7 of 24 Figure 4.

In comparison to the beneﬁts received for clearing a block, it has been discovered that electrical costs associated with mining the digital currency are higher [ 20]. Cryptocurrency mining has consumed much electricity. The price of mining varies depending on the efﬁciency of the hardware.

These individuals switch between pools in an effort to lower the pools’ mining results and reduce the value of the blocks they have mined [24]. 4.

According to the ﬁndings of the experiment, space-saving for summary blocks is 22.318 percent, and space-saving for compressed summary blocks is 78.104 percent. By enabling data storage to be accessible, decentralized, and unchangeable, blockchains have revolutionized storage space.

In addition to having a low scaling capacity, these methods only achieve weak security guarantees because they either have a high failure probability or a low fault resiliency (e.g., 1/8 and 1/4) or because they are based on strong assumptions (e.g., trusted setup), which limits their potential application to common payment services [81].

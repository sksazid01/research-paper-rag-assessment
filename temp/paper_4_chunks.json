Theoretical Background 2.1.

Maritime transport sustainability means the ability to provide accessible, a ordable, reliable, safe, socially inclusive, economical, a nd environme ntally friendly transport infrastructure and services [ 11]. The shipping should be e \u000ecient and sustainable in order to enable the growth of the global economy, but it should also focus on protecting the environment, cost-e ectiv eness, and providing safe and energy-e \u000ecient global transport of goods [8]. While researching the three pillars of sustainability, Oh, Lee, and Seo [ 12] identiﬁed the key management criteria for sustainable seaport business: an environmental management criterion includes environmental policy, environmental risks reduction, and stakeholder collaboration [ 12].",

With regard to the economic sustainability aspect, economic parameters may (among others) include connectivity, market access, trade competitiveness, infrastructure capacity, and transport costs [ 11], which represent a signiﬁcant portion of total logistics costs for many organizations [ 13,14]. Currently, the attention is being paid not only to the economic but also to the ecological issues of transportation, with the aim to lower the damaging impact on the Sustainability 2020 ,12, 8866 3 of 19 environment [ 15].

In maritime transport, an increasing focus is placed on the environmental aspect of sustainability because of tightening emission regulations and stakeholder demands. Non-compliance or inactivity related to environmental sustainability can ultimately lead to unexpected costs for companies [ 16]. With regard to the social aspect of sustainability, safety and security, health, employment, employee engagement, and working conditions should be considered [11,17]. Seaports represent the important logistics and transport chains’ nodes and are at the core of national and regional economies [ 18]. In order to achieve seaport sustainability, it is necessary to integrate environmentally friendly methods of seaport activities, operations, and management. As load ing and unloading are among the main activities in seaports, unnecessary waiting for cargo due to ine ective, obsolete document exchange causes the increase of CO 2emissions [ 13].",

Furt hermore, the bottlene cks and truck congestion inside and outside the container terminal can lead to serious local environmental problems such as noise and harmful emissions, but also to major ine \u000eciencies in various operations [ 19]. The importance of the environmental aspect of seaport sustainability is increasingly recognized by the port authorities, port users, policy makers, and local commun ities.

The blockchain may be deﬁned as a record-keeping system that stores transaction record information that is shared peer-to-peer, including all computers within the network [ 22]. In blockchain technology, transactions are stored in a distributed ledger; the copies are available with each node, enabling transparency [ 23]. This node network will be secured against inaccurate or malicious alterations caused by a defective data source (either one of the nodes or an external attacker) [ 24]. The blockchain is a “chain of blocks” containing details of a transaction for a speciﬁc time period that cannot be edited easily. The “block” is related to transactions and represents the basic blockchain unit, while the “chain” connects the transactions into one chain.",

The bloc kchain technology principle is achieved through a decentralized peer-to-peer network, i.e., through a network through which the data is shared between many working units [ 25]. The blockchain can be divided into two types according to openness and access to data: public and private [ 26]. According to [ 27], the public and private networks di er in terms of access to the ledger. In the public network, each user has a copy of the ledger and participates independently in the conforming transactions, while in the case of a private network, participants need permission to keep a copy of the general ledger and participate in the conﬁrmation of transactions [27].",

The blockchain also supports more advanced concepts, such as smart contracts and the smart pro perty, also known as tokenized assets [ 3]. Smart contracts may be characterized as distributed transactions that are stored on the blockchain, allowing highly automated workﬂows that do not require human interaction [ 28]. A smart contract is a self-executing pre-evaluated contract that aims to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or the contract execution [ 29,30]. The smart contracting may be deﬁned as the usage of a blockchain technology-based computer program in order to support and automate the execution of contractual agreements [ 31]. The smart contracts may perform num erous fun ctions, such as the automatic change of ownership of goods, execution of payments , and e ven compensation or insurance payments for late deliveries to the compensate the relevant parties [5].",

Bitcoin and blockchain technology Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on the blockchain techno logy, which make use of secure cryptographic algorithms supported by a peer -to-peer network. Blockchain is based on the following assumption: it rely on a peer -to-peer network and there is no need of a central server, it has a distributed consensus protoco l that consists of digital signature and cryptography based on asymmetric public key mechanism, a timestamp system to make transaction traceable in a peer -to-peer network in which all nodes in the network are equal peers.",

For example, Giungato et al. (2019)  illustrate a n innovative application blockchain who consists in DNS (domain name system) project called “Blockstack”. This decentralised technology DNS is a repository of web address - Internet Protocol address. Block chain technology represents a different mapping DNS -like system, which, replace DNS root servers in resettling domain names into IP addresses. The goal of developers is to substitute servers controlled by corporations and governments with Blockchain DNS in troducing decentralization, decreasing censorship resistance and increasing security and privacy events (Ali, 2016).

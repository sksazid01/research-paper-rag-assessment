## 📊 Test Dataset Compliance

### ✅ Sample Papers

Task says: "5 Sample Papers Provided in `sample_papers/` directory"

| Expected File | Status | Actual File |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| `paper1_machine_learning.pdf` | ⚠️ NAMING | `paper_1.pdf` ✅ EXISTS |
| `paper2_neural_networks.pdf` | ⚠️ NAMING | `paper_2.pdf` ✅ EXISTS |
| `paper3_nlp_transformers.pdf` | ⚠️ NAMING | `paper_3.pdf` ✅ EXISTS |
| `paper4_computer_vision.pdf` | ⚠️ NAMING | `paper_4.pdf` ✅ EXISTS |
| `paper5_reinforcement_learning.pdf` | ⚠️ NAMING | `paper_5.pdf` ✅ EXISTS |

**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUE** - File naming convention differs
- **Task expects:** `paper1_machine_learning.pdf`
- **Project has:** `paper_1.pdf`

**Impact:** LOW - Functionality works fine, just naming difference

**Recommendation:** This is likely pre-existing in the assessment repo. If these papers were provided by the evaluator, no change needed. If you created them, consider renaming for exact match.

## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found

### 1. Sample Papers Naming Convention
**Issue:** File names don't match Task_Instructions.md exactly
- **Expected:** `paper1_machine_learning.pdf`
- **Actual:** `paper_1.pdf`

**Impact:** VERY LOW - Functionality unaffected
**Recommendation:** If these papers were provided in the assessment repo, no action needed. If you created them, consider renaming for perfect match.

**Fix (optional):**
```bash
cd sample_papers/
mv paper_1.pdf paper1_machine_learning.pdf
mv paper_2.pdf paper2_neural_networks.pdf
mv paper_3.pdf paper3_nlp_transformers.pdf
mv paper_4.pdf paper4_computer_vision.pdf
mv paper_5.pdf paper5_reinforcement_learning.pdf
```

### 2. Architecture Diagram File
**Issue:** `architecture.png` mentioned in Task_Instructions.md but not present
**Actual:** Mermaid diagram in README.md (arguably better!)

**Impact:** NONE - Mermaid is more maintainable
**Recommendation:** No action needed. Mermaid diagram is superior.
